# 📜 ProofStell Smart Contract

Decentralized document verification contract built with Soroban.

---

## 🌍 Overview

This smart contract powers the **on-chain verification layer** of ProofStell.

It stores **cryptographic hashes of documents** and enables:

* Document registration
* Verification
* Revocation

---

## 🚀 Core Features

### 📄 Document Registry

* Store document hashes on-chain
* Ensure immutability

---

### 🔎 Verification

* Check if a document exists
* Confirm authenticity

---

### 🧾 Revocation

* Allow issuers to revoke documents
* Maintain revocation state

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Document is hashed (SHA256)

2. Hash is submitted to contract

3. Contract stores:

   * Issuer address
   * Owner address
   * Timestamp
   * Status

4. Verification compares hash with stored record

## 🗄️ Cache Behavior

### TTL Enforcement

Both the in-memory and Redis backends honor TTL values:

- **Redis** — uses `SET EX` so entries are natively evicted after `ttl` seconds.
- **InMemory** — stores an `expires_at` timestamp alongside each value. A `get` that finds an expired entry returns a cache miss (same semantics as Redis).

The TTL for verification results is controlled by the `CACHE_VERIFICATION_TTL` environment variable (default: `3600` seconds).

### Typed Cache Keys

Cache keys are typed via the `CacheKey` enum to prevent namespace collisions:

| Variant | Prefix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `CacheKey::Verification(hash)` | `verification:` | `verification:e3b0c4…` |
| `CacheKey::Config(key)` | `config:` | `config:rate_limit` |

Callers must use the appropriate variant — raw string keys are no longer accepted.

### Metrics

The `MetricsRegistry` exposes the following cache-related counters:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| `cache_hits_total` | Entry found and returned |
| `cache_misses_total` | Entry not found |
| `cache_expired_total` | Entry found but TTL had elapsed (counted as miss) |
| `cache_serialization_failures_total` | Deserialization error on a cached value |

### Operational Tuning

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CACHE_VERIFICATION_TTL` | `3600` | Seconds before a cached verification result expires |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://127.0.0.1:6379` | Redis connection string (production) |

Set `REDIS_URL` to a real Redis instance in production. The in-memory backend is suitable for local development and testing only.

## 🧪 Future Improvements

* Issuer registry system
* Multi-signature verification
* Zero-knowledge proofs
* Credential NFTs

---

## 🎯 Goal

To provide a **trustless, immutable verification layer** for documents using blockchain.

**ProofStell Contract — Trust anchored on-chain.**
